This directory is temporary, and should eventually be integrated with the rest of hippunfold (eg. templateShape files should be in resources/). The goal is to replace all matlab code used in autotop.smk with simplified snakemake, bash, or python code. Eventually we should be able to copmpletely remove hippocampal_autotop (which contains a lot of unused files and code). 

NOTE: the template in template shape injection used here has a proper header and should rought align to CITI corob space.
